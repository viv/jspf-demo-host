### Java Simple Plugin Framework (JSPF) Demo
This is a simple demo of the the Java Simple Plugin Framework (JSPF). Visit the project 
homepage at https://code.google.com/p/jspf/ for more information on JSPF.

### Demo Structure
There is a single main application which supports plugins. The main application uses 
plugins to output a simple greeting in different languages. This demo has two plugins 
which output a greeting in French and English. Plugins are added to the main application 
as JAR files. Each plugin has its own project repository from which JARs are created.

This code requires that you have jspf.core-1.0.2.jar on your classpath.
